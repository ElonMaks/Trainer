/*
 * Harder version of classic memory game where the player has to remember location of
 * 4-9 various colors on 8x8 matrix. The board is classic chessboard (to make this challenge
 * more comfortable then playing on blank matrix).
 *
 * Game starts with showing each of colors (from chosen palette selected in settings screen)
 * in randomly selected fields on the board for a few seconds (time is set in settings). Then
 * game is going into proper phase, where player is enable to drag colors from colorsToDrag
 * (MemocolorToDrag vector) and put them into any place on chessboard as tickFields
 * (MemocolorOnBoard). When every color is already dragged challenge is finished. Game comes
 * into phase of checking result - tickFields which are incorrect are getting hidden and after
 * a short delay player is able to see them in correct places. At the same time player receive
 * points for the correct ones. Then stage is clear and round counter raises.
